# Competency Tree PoC

This is a PoC for the Competency Tree feature in Connect. Be aware that this is just to experiment with different implementations so not everything is fully complete. The major areas that still aren't working are the ability to edit existing competencies and the ability to compose Competency nodes together from the frontend.

The most important features to look at are the components to create new knowledge nodes and competency trees and the talent tree component.

Documentation and source code for the frontend and backend can be found in /frontend and /backend respectfully.
